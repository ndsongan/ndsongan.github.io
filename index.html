            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I am currently a first year Ph.D student in Computer Science at the Ohio State University.
                My research interests include data analytics, machine learning, graph theory, and mathematical 
                modeling. I am specifically interested in applying computational methods in the field of
                public health. Although those are my areas of interest, I am also open to other 
                research in the field of mathematics and computer science.
            </p>
            <p>
                Previously, I graduated from Saint John's University with a Bachelor of Arts degree 
                in Mathematics and Computer Science in May 2022. I am looking for summer internship positions 
                in software engineer and/or data analytics as well as research positions.
            </p>
